========================
SHMUP - Kévin NAUDIN========================
This is my Java project. It basically is a SHMUP game base on the Star Wars universe.
To run the game, just start the SHMUP.jar file.
Please do not remove files or move them else the game won't launch.
If you'd like to modify the level, you can do so by editing the lvl1.dat file located inside the
Levels folder.
